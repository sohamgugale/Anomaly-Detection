# Real-Time Fraud Detection System

Unsupervised anomaly detection for credit card fraud using ensemble methods.

## Overview
This project implements an anomaly detection system using LSTM Autoencoders and Isolation Forest to identify fraudulent transactions without requiring labeled fraud examples during training.

## Features
- Unsupervised learning approach
- Ensemble method (LSTM Autoencoder + Isolation Forest)
- Real-time detection capability
- Model explainability with SHAP

## Dataset
Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset from Kaggle
- 284,807 transactions
- 492 frauds (0.173%)
- Highly imbalanced data

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (deployment)
- SHAP (explainability)

## Project Status
🚧 In Development
